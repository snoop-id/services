Crawling registered domain names by contract addresses on different networks.

## How it works?
Iterating through space.id contract transactions to crawl domain names. Currently, `infura` node is used. Our priority is crawling as much as we can. In the future, our own nodes will be used.

## Requirements
Check `config.ts` to see used services. You must grab API keys of used services.
